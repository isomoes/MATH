*What is Symmetry*

#note[
  We think symmetry is much like a one-to-one map; it is an isomorphism.

_A symmetry is an undetectable *motion*. An object is symmetric if it has symmetries._

Here is an essential observation: If I leave the room and you perform two undetectable motions one after the other, I will not be able to detect the result.
The result of two symmetries one after the other is also a symmetry.
